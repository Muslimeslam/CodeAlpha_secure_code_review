Secure Code Review Project
Task Overview
This project focuses on secure code review by identifying vulnerabilities in Python code. I created a script (reiman.py) and utilized the Bandit security analysis tool to review the code for security risks and adherence to best practices.

How to Use Bandit for Code Review
Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed.
Install Bandit using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install bandit
Running Bandit
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Review the Code:
Run Bandit recursively on the Python file:

bash
Copy code
bandit -r reiman.py
Analyze the Results:
Bandit will output a list of potential security issues along with severity levels and recommendations.

Example:

plaintext
Copy code
[B101] Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when compiling to optimized byte code.
Location: ./reiman.py:15
Severity: Medium   Confidence: High
Example Output
Here’s a sample result of running Bandit on reiman.py:

plaintext
Copy code
Run started: 2024-11-27 14:00:00

Test results:
>> Issue: [B303] Use of insecure MD5 hash function.
   Severity: High   Confidence: High
   Location: ./reiman.py:23

>> Issue: [B404] Import of subprocess module detected. Consider using safer alternatives.
   Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
   Location: ./reiman.py:45
Fixing Issues
Follow Bandit’s suggestions to fix identified vulnerabilities:

Replace insecure hashing algorithms like MD5 with SHA-256.
Avoid using assert in production environments.
Use safer practices for command execution, such as sanitizing inputs in subprocess.run().
